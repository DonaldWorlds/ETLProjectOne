## Updated `metadata/` README

### `metadata/` Directory

This directory stores the ETL system’s **memory**, not business data. It answers:

- What happened on each run?
- What did we consider the baseline at that time?
- What changed, and when?
- Why did we ingest, skip, or alert?

Current contents:

- `metadata/hashes/`
  - One `.md5` file per source CSV.
  - Each file stores the last trusted timestamp + hash for that CSV.
- `metadata/row_counts/`
  - One `.rows` file per source CSV.
  - Each file stores total rows and data rows at baseline.
- `metadata/ingestion_log.md`
  - Append‑only Markdown log.
  - Each section documents:
    - Run timestamp and version
    - Decision (`ingest` / `skip` / `alert`)
    - Per‑file previous vs current hash/row count
    - Any schema issues or notes
- Optionally `metadata/kaggle_version.txt` (if you keep the Kaggle version helper):
  - Stores the last known Kaggle dataset version or timestamp.

Important:

- Files in `metadata/` are generated by code and **should not be edited by manually**.
